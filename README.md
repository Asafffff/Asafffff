I am a self-taught NodeJS & Python developer, with some affinity to the DevOps world.

I'm a curious person that loves to research everything he's interested in. For me, having a basic understanding of the whole development process is a must in order to code better programs.

I always knew that I would work with computers at a young age. My first coding experience started with automating some Excel worksheets (VBA) that saved me hours in total of daily work. That encouraged me to build more programs that can ease anything I do - If it were programs to find profitable products at the time I was selling at eBay, or a web app to help me memorize vocabulary for the Psychometric exam. Since then, I've gained more experience in enterprise development from the companies in which I've worked.
